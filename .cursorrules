# .cursorrules - Rules for AI Pair Programming

# This file guides the AI's behavior to ensure consistency and adherence to the project's architecture.

# 1. Core Principles
- The single source of truth is the latest GitHub commit URL provided by the user.
- Adhere strictly to the step-by-step plan in `PROJECT.md`.
- All code must be compliant with the rulings in `spec.md`.
- Provide one numbered prompt at a time. Do not combine steps.
- After providing a prompt, also provide the exact `git commit` command to be used upon success.

# 2. File and Directory Structure
- All new pages must be created inside the `src/app` directory, following Next.js App Router conventions.
- All new reusable components must be created inside the `src/components` directory.
- Use the `@/*` path alias for all imports of local modules from the `src` directory (e.g., `import Foo from '@/components/Foo'`).

# 3. Code Style and Conventions
- All code must be written in TypeScript.
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Do not write custom CSS files outside of `globals.css`.
- Follow the existing code style for formatting and naming conventions.
- Remove the `prefetch={false}` prop from all Next.js `<Link>` components, as per the architectural ruling.
- Use React Server Actions for form submissions and other server mutations, as per the architectural ruling.
